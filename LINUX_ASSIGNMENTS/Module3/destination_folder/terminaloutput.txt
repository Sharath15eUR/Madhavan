1. Automating file backup and reporting to the system by creating a shell script "backup_manager.sh" and performing the required actions

Ans : 

maddy@maddy-IdeaPad-Slim-3-15IAH8:~$ ls Desktop/LINUX_ASSIGNMENTS/Module1/Q5/dir1
f1.txt  f2.txt  f3.txt
maddy@maddy-IdeaPad-Slim-3-15IAH8:~$ ls Desktop/LINUX_ASSIGNMENTS/Module3
backup_manager.sh
maddy@maddy-IdeaPad-Slim-3-15IAH8:~$ cd Desktop/LINUX_ASSIGNMENTS/Module3
maddy@maddy-IdeaPad-Slim-3-15IAH8:~/Desktop/LINUX_ASSIGNMENTS/Module3$ ./backup_manager.sh "/home/maddy/Desktop/LINUX_ASSIGNMENTS/Module1/Q5/dir1" "$PWD" ".txt"

Source Directory exists. Proceeding to check whether files and/or subdirectories exist or not

Files or subdirectories exist

Backup directory is ready

Files going to backed up from given source to given destination directory
149	f1.txt
885	f2.txt
0	f3.txt

File f1.txt does not exist in destination folder so creating copy of it in destination folder
File f2.txt does not exist in destination folder so creating copy of it in destination folder
File f3.txt does not exist in destination folder so creating copy of it in destination folder

maddy@maddy-IdeaPad-Slim-3-15IAH8:~/Desktop/LINUX_ASSIGNMENTS/Module3$ cd

maddy@maddy-IdeaPad-Slim-3-15IAH8:~$ ls Desktop/LINUX_ASSIGNMENTS/Module3
backup_manager.sh  backup_report.log  f1.txt  f2.txt  f3.txt
maddy@maddy-IdeaPad-Slim-3-15IAH8:~$ cd Desktop/LINUX_ASSIGNMENTS/Module3
maddy@maddy-IdeaPad-Slim-3-15IAH8:~/Desktop/LINUX_ASSIGNMENTS/Module3$ cat backup_report.log
Files that are backed up from /home/maddy/Desktop/LINUX_ASSIGNMENTS/Module1/Q5/dir1 are as follows : 
f1.txt
f2.txt
f3.txt
Total files backed up is 3
Total Size got backed up is 1034
Path to the backup directory is : /home/maddy/Desktop/LINUX_ASSIGNMENTS/Module3
