1. For the given input.txt , write a bash script which should take the file as input and have to go through it line by line and need to generate an output file (here: output.txt) with listiings of given parameters fetched from the input file.   (parameters are frame.type , wfan.fc.type and wlan.fc.subtype)

Ans : 

maddy@maddy-IdeaPad-Slim-3-15IAH8:~/Desktop/LINUX_ASSIGNMENTS/Module4$ ls
input.txt  script.sh
maddy@maddy-IdeaPad-Slim-3-15IAH8:~/Desktop/LINUX_ASSIGNMENTS/Module4$ ./script.sh "$PWD/input.txt"
maddy@maddy-IdeaPad-Slim-3-15IAH8:~/Desktop/LINUX_ASSIGNMENTS/Module4$ ls
input.txt  output.txt  script.sh
maddy@maddy-IdeaPad-Slim-3-15IAH8:~/Desktop/LINUX_ASSIGNMENTS/Module4$ cat output.txt

"frame.time": "Dec 31, 2024 12:50:25.890970000 India Standard Time",
"wlan.fc.type": "0",
"wlan.fc.subtype": "8",
"frame.time": "Dec 31, 2024 12:50:25.892357000 India Standard Time",
"wlan.fc.type": "0",
"wlan.fc.subtype": "8",



(SINCE , WHOLE FILE TAKES LONG TIME TO PROCESS , FOR OUTPUT DEMONSTRATION , FIRST 3000 LINES OF INPUT DOCUMENT WAS CONSIDERED)
