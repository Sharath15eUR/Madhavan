IPERF TOOL

1. It is a powerful networking tool used to test or measure the bandwidth , latency and performance of TCP, UDP (packet loss statistics) , SCTP connections between two devices. 

2. It supports both IPv4 and IPv6.

3. Allows setting custom bandwidth, packet size , window size etc.

4. It follows client-server architecture. That is, iperf server should be running on one terminal and other terminal should initiate iperf client request with any parameters required to test.

5. It requires installing "sudo apt install iperf3 -y" in ubuntu

6. In server machine, "iperf3 -s" to be executed, this process makes iperf3 listen to particular port (Eg. 5201).

7. In client machine, "iperf3 -c <server_ip> -t <specific timeout> -p <specific port which server is listening to> -R (in reverse mode) -P <number of parallel channels required>

8. iperf3 testing can be done between two laptops , between laptop and mobile phone and within localhost too. (two machines should be connected in same network)

9. In case of using mobile phone as one side, iperf3 application can be donwloaded and mode can be set. 

10. In localhost, during client request, instead of server iP, 127.0.0.1 can be used. 

11. After testing ,server should be stopped by using exit command, if it doesn't work, identify the process ID using ps aux | grep iperf3 , and kill that process either gracefully or forcibly.

12. By default, iperf3 tests tcp connections, to make it test UDP connections, -u option can be sert in iperf3 client request.

13. To check multicast, server side should bind with any valid multicast address using -B option and udp option should be set. In client side, same multicast address should be specified with udp flag enabled.
