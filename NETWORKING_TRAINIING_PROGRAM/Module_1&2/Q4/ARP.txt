ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) : 

	It is used to provide MAC address if IP address is given. It is used in following scenarios
	
	1. Whenever any host in LAN wants to have communication across its LAN , it approaches default gateway by its MAC with its own private IP. Router's interface (acts as default gateway) does NAT and makes the entry of this private IP to router's IP : Port for public communication . Once , appropriate response in the IP of router's intended interface is obtained , it reverse maps to identify the IP of the target device and then it checks in its local ARP cache to find readily the MAC of target device. If not found , it floods ARP broadcast in that LAN and requests for its MAC and completes the sending process. 
	
	2. Any end host device will first check its own ARP cache to find the MAC of the destination device in case if destination is present inside same LAN. 
	
	3. ARP entry will be dynamically updated or statically entered. 
	
	
	
COMMANDS : 

1. Using arp command without any option will show the IP address, Hardware type, MAC address , flags mask (C - complete , M - manually added entry , D - dynamically learned entry , I -incomplete and !- failed arp resolution - host is unreachable) and Interface name of current interface as follows :

maddy@maddy-IdeaPad-Slim-3-15IAH8:~$ arp 
Address                  HWtype  HWaddress           Flags Mask            Iface
_gateway                 ether   d2:0e:ad:74:3e:43   C                     wlp0s20f3



2. Using "a" option with arp will list all types of entries as shown : 

maddy@maddy-IdeaPad-Slim-3-15IAH8:~$ arp -n
Address                  HWtype  HWaddress           Flags Mask            Iface
192.168.90.217           ether   d2:0e:ad:74:3e:43   C                     wlp0s20f3
maddy@maddy-IdeaPad-Slim-3-15IAH8:~$ arp -a


3. Users can request the MAC of any particular IP directly. If available in cache , the corresponding entry will be provided as follows : 

maddy@maddy-IdeaPad-Slim-3-15IAH8:~$ arp _gateway
Address                  HWtype  HWaddress           Flags Mask            Iface
_gateway                 ether   d2:0e:ad:74:3e:43   C                     wlp0s20f3


4. Alternative to arp command in ubuntu - ip neigh show . This is used as follows : 

maddy@maddy-IdeaPad-Slim-3-15IAH8:~$ ip neigh show
192.168.90.217 dev wlp0s20f3 lladdr d2:0e:ad:74:3e:43 REACHABLE
fe80::d00e:adff:fe74:3e43 dev wlp0s20f3 lladdr d2:0e:ad:74:3e:43 router DELAY
2409:40f4:101d:c1b3::96 dev wlp0s20f3 lladdr d2:0e:ad:74:3e:43 router REACHABLE

(in first row, an IP follwed by interface name and its status is given. In second row , it is identified as router with both IPv6 global and local link addresses are given with its status)
