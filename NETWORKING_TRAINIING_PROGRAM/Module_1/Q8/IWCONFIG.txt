IWCONFIG :

	iwconfig command is used to view and configure wireless network interfaces. It is the part of "wireless-tools" package. 
	
	
COMMANDS:

1. Installing wireless-tools package in ubuntu machine.

maddy@maddy-IdeaPad-Slim-3-15IAH8:~$ sudo apt install wireless-tools

wireless-tools is already the newest version (30~pre9-13.1ubuntu4).
wireless-tools set to manually installed.
0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 205 not upgraded.



2. Using iwconfig command without any options will list all wireless interfaces and its network related information as follows:

lo        no wireless extensions.

wlp0s20f3  IEEE 802.11  ESSID:"Redmi Note 11 Pro+ 5G"  
          Mode:Managed  Frequency:5.18 GHz  Access Point: D2:0E:AD:74:3E:43   
          Bit Rate=433.3 Mb/s   Tx-Power=22 dBm   
          Retry short limit:7   RTS thr:off   Fragment thr:off
          Power Management:on
          Link Quality=56/70  Signal level=-54 dBm  
          Rx invalid nwid:0  Rx invalid crypt:0  Rx invalid frag:0
          Tx excessive retries:0  Invalid misc:5   Missed beacon:0


(Here , a wifi interface is found whose information like ssid , Managed Mode (default for all wifi clients - getting managed by access points. Other modes are AD-Hoc , Montior mode for sniffing) , Frequency of operation , access point (Wireless wifi router) MAC , Tx, Rx power , bit rate , speed etc will be provided)

3. It is possible to list only the required interface by using iwconfig <interface name>

4. To change the ssid of any interface, following is the syntax : 

sudo iwconfig <wireless interface> essid "<new ssid>"

5. To change the mode : 

sudo iwconfig wlan0 mode Ad-Hoc

6. To manually set the fragmentation threshold in case of exceeding MTU

sudo iwconfig wlan0 frag 512

7. To list the nearby wifi interface (access points) : 

sudo iwlist wlan0 scan

8. To manually set RTS threshold (RTS is the first signal sent by the end host in wireless interface to check for busy network) 

sudo iwconfig wlan0 rts 2347
