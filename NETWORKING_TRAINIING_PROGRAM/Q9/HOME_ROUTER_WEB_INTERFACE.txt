Home router's web interface is by default via default gateway. 

This can be verified by using ip route command - > which shows the IP of default gateway. 

TO CHECK THE LIST OF CONNECTED DEVICES : 

1. MOBILE HOTSPOT : 

		Settings -> Mobile Hotspot -> Connected devices list will be shown there
		
2. VIA ROUTER OR ACCESS POINTS :

		
		arp -a -> command will list all the connected device that this particular host found 
		
		http://<Address of default gateway>  -> will redirect to the website of the router where upon appropriate credentials , connected devices can be found.
