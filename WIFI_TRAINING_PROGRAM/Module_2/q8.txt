1. Basically Autonomous APs run its own wireless stack that is handling client authentication , encryption, security policies, vlan management, integration services etc.

2. Each APs to be configured independently either via SSH or via inbuilt CLI with no automation may lead to misconfigurations due to human errors. 

3. Each AP will have their own RF parameters set, it will not change based on the dynamic channel conditions by monitoring it leading to Interference, coverage loss etc. 

4. Due to the lack of fast centralized control, roaming become less efficient and leads to frequent disconnections and re-authentications.

5. Due to inconsistent Security policy enforcements, it might become impossible to detect Rogue APs in the network.

6. Network analytics (gathering network insights for improved handling) (number of clients per AP and places where signals go weak) becomes impossible.

7. Firmware updates are to be done on individual APs

8. There will be not be any dynamic load balancing with RRM, DFS without central orchestration. 

9. For any new APs being joined, every single process of configuration to be done independently without cloning. 

10. Since all processes are done by APs itself, power optimization cannot be done. 

11. It is tedious in mesh networks without auto adjustments based on Dynamic paths and AP failure.
