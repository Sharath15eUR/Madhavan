OFDM FOR WLAN

1. Since the channel as LTI filter smearing the symbols across time , ISI will be created thereby copies of the same signal with different delay may reach receiver. 

2. OFDM combats this by splitting the channel to multiple subcarriers reducing the frequency selective nature.

3. Offers much longer symbol duration (though expensive at receiver end) than that of delay spread.

4. Attaching cyclic prefix with OFDM symbol converts works against ISI (linear to circular convolution)

5. Even if some subcarrier data is lost, majority of the data reaches receiver. Moreover, Pilot sequences in the front of OFDM symbol helps in assessing the channel for receiver.

6. Tight spectral packing of subcarriers when compared to conventional FDM by ensuring orthogonality between subcarriers.

7. Adaptive bit loading uses higher modulation for good subcarriers dynamically.

8. Receiver setup becomes single tap equalizer for each subcarrier.

9. OFDM paves the way for advancements such as MU-MIMO enabling multiple streams per subcarrier, Beamforming for phase control per subcarrier, allocating different subcarriers to different users serving multiple users simultaneously, TWT scheduling of OFDM symbols for power saving.
