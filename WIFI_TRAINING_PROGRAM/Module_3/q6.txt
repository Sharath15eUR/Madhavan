GUARD INTERVAL : 

1. It is the time duration inserted between consecutive OFDM symbols to let receiver absorb any delayed versions of previous symbols due to multipath propagation.

2. Guard intervals will not be left empty or null rather in that duration, portion of OFDM (last) will be occupied in front for tackling the effect of tail overlapping.

3. Guard interval = cyclic prefix duration which simplifies the FFT equalization in receiver.

4. It will be effective iff duration of guard interval is greater than maximum delay spread.

5. However, more guard interval may reduce throughput as it is occupied with redundant data.

6. Thus choosing guard interval depends on the environment (Office - 200 to 300 nS since RMS delay spread is around 100 nS , Residential - 500 nS since RMS delay spread is around 200 nS, Stadium - 1 uS since RMS delay spread is around 500 nS)

7. Short GI (0.4 uS) is acceptable in low multipath areas like small homes offering higher throughput.

8. Standard GI (0.8 uS) in most indoor environments

9. Long GI (1.6-3.2 uS) in stadiums
