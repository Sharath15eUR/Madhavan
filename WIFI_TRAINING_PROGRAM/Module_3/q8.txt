OFDM AND OFDMA

OFDM : 

1. Splits a high-rate stream into many low-rate parallel streams over orthogonal subcarriers.

2. Single-user can only access the channel at a time.

3. Introduced in 802.11a/g/n/ac

4. Inefficient for small packets or multiple users.

5. Works with smaller FFT sizes when compared to OFDMA

6. Medium access is controlled by CSMA/CA (contention-based).

7. Offers moderate spectral efficiency

8. Latency increases in dense networks.

9. Easier receiver sync when compared to that of OFDMA

10. Ideal for high throughput single user devices


OFDMA : 

1. It allows multiple users to transmit/receive on different sets of subcarriers simultaneously

2. Thereby Multi-user can access the channel at any time.

3. Introduced in 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6) and 802.11be (Wi-Fi 7)

4. Scheduler divides subcarriers into Resource Units (RUs)

5. Efficient for IoT, mixed traffic and dense network applications

6. Parallel data transmission is enabled via RU which is split to users based on priority and data traffic.

7. It uses higher FFT size when compared with that of OFDM for finer RU granularity

8. Trigger Frames (from AP) allocate RUs for uplink and Multi-user Downlink is broadcast with specific RU mapping thereby controlled via centralized scheduling.

9. Offers lower latency with higher spectral efficiency.

10. Subcarrier Water filling (power control) algorithm per RU is possible

11. But all users should be in perfect sync during reception which is complex to achieve.

12. OFDMA is more scalable than OFDM.
