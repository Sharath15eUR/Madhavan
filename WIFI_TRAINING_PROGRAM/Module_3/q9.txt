MIMO and MU-MIMO :

MIMO 

1. Introduced in 802.11n (Wi-Fi 4)

2. Offers spatial multiplexing for one user mainly if receiver understands channel (CSR) if not, then multiplexing efficiency can be compromised by using Alamouti-STBC

3. Uses multiple transmit and receive antennas.

4. Each spatial stream carries independent data.

5. Streams are separated using spatial diversity and channel estimation at the receiver.

6. Applied in both uplink and downlink streams.

7. Receiver should estimate the channel and cancel the effect of interference to get data


MU-MIMO

1.  Introduced in 802.11ac (downlink), 802.11ax (DL/UL)

2.  Offers Spatial multiplexing for multiple users

3.  Multiple users per transmission interval

4.  Efficient in dense networks

5.  Access Point (AP) uses spatial beamforming to steer data to different users.

6.  Requires advanced scheduling and Channel State Information (CSI).

7.  Precoding will be required to get data with minimal cross talk.

8.  Scheduler is required which groups users based on channel orthogonality, QoS etc.
