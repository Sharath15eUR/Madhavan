FRAME FORMAT FOR WIFI

1. Generally, for Data link layer in OSI, frame format follows common structure. That is, 

	MAC Header | Frame body | FCS

2. Frame body and FCS (Wifi follows CRC) remains the same but Frame header changes for wifi

3. Wifi frame format is given below:

	Frame control (2) | Duration/ID (2) | Add-1 (6) | Add-2 (6) | Add-3 (6) | Seq No (2) | Add-3 (6) | QoS (2) | HT field (2) | Frame body (0-2304 with overhead for security) | FCS (4)

3. Frame control field in wifi contains the following:

	1. Protocol - 00 for wifi
	2. Type - Defines whether the frame is Management (00), Control (01), or Data (10)
	3. Subtype - Identifies the specific type of frame (e.g., Beacon, RTS, CTS, Data)
	4. To DS - Set if the frame is heading to the Distribution System (AP)
	5. From DS - Set if the frame is coming from the Distribution System (AP)
	6. More Fragments - Set if the frame is fragmented
	7. Retry -  Set if this is a retransmitted frame
	8. Power Management - Indicates whether the STA is in power-saving mode
	9. More Data - 	Indicates additional buffered data at the AP for power-saving STAs
	10.Protected Frame - Set if the frame is encrypted (WEP, WPA, WPA2)
	11.Order - Set for strictly ordered frames

To DS=0 and From DS=1: A1-Dest STA , A2-BSSID, A3-Actual sender in DS
To DS=1 and From DS=0: A1-BSSID , A2 - Source-STA , A3 - Actual destination in DS. 
To DS=0 and From DS=0: Frame for AP, Frame for broadcast, DLS
To DS=1 and From DS=1: in Mesh networking

4. Duration/ID : 

	1. In conventional frames, it represents NAV (Network Allocation Vector) to reserve channel and to let other users know that channel will be reserved for that duration. 
	2. In power save poll frames, it contains Association ID 

5. ADD-1: It represents the immediate destination or recipient

6. ADD-2: It represents the immediate source

7. ADD-3: it represents either actual destination or actual source 

8. Seq No: In case of fragmentation, it represents which seq frames are being fragmented

9. ADD-4 : Used in the case of multi-hop routing.

10. Frame body - 0 to 2304 bytes with either layer-3 data or encrypted data or QoS data.

11. FCS - CRC-32 bits for frame integrity.
