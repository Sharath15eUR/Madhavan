OFDMA 

1. Stands for Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access. It is the simple extension of OFDM.

2. In OFDM, all subcarriers generated were used by single user at a time leading to reduced efficiency in terms of multi user support.

3. In OFDMA, in the name of Resource Units, users will be allocated with some contiguous subcarriers for use. 

4. APs send Trigger frames in TBRA for Uplink OFDMA thereby assigning appropriate RU, timing, power settings for which clients respond in their allocated time slot. (Uplink)

5. It sends common preamble followed by each user's data in their assigned RU. (Downlink)

6. It is more useful in the case of IoT transmission where many devices send small packets may not occupy the entire channel in OFDMA.

7. Since multiple devices can transmit simultaneously, latency is avoided leading to predictable performance.

8. RU based TWT allocation can be done for power saving.

9. Replaces CSMA/CA + backoff for STAs with Uplink scheduling.

10. QoS is enhanced by Dynamic RU allocation.
