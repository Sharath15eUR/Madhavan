6 GHz in Wifi-6E

1. In case of 2.4 GHz band, it is technologically congested with either microwave oven or Bluetooth and etc. Moreover, it has only 3 non-overlapping channels for use.

2. In case of 5 GHz band, though it has around 25+ non overlapping channels (might not suffice in dense environments though), those are subjected to Dynamic Frequency Selection due to radar interference.

3. 6 GHz frequency often offers true 160 and 320 MHz ultra wide channels without congestion for high throughput applications.

4. It offers around 60+ non overlapping 20 MHz channels for use. 

5. Devices with 6 GHz wifi will not get interference from previous wifi generation devices due to new spectrum usage (green field)

6. Recent wifi generations with 6 GHz support BSS coloring, TWT, MLO, OFDMA like advanced techniques promoting speed, safety, efficiency, QoS etc.

7. Though it offers only very small range, within that range, very high throughput can be achieved and moreover this easily isolates very closely spaced networks.

8. 6 GHz wifi generations use very advanced wifi security like SAE with Management frame protection techniques.

9. It is even advantageous to combine it with IoT devices since they can communicate without interference with many RU possible reducing overall latency in communication.
