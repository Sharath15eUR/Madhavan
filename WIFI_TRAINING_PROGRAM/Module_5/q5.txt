COMPARING WIFI-6 AND WIFI-6E

1. 2.4 and 5 GHz were used in wifi-6. But, 6 GHz was introduced in wifi-6E

2. Wifi-6 can cover much higher range and supports good penetration but wifi-6E cannot support because of higher frequency and higher path loss. Therefore, it is well suited on open environments and line of sight shorter range communications.

3. Bandwidth of around 500 MHz is allocated in wifi-6, but 1200 MHz in case of wifi-6E

4. 25+ non-overlapping 20 MHz channels are available in wifi-6 but around 60+ non-overlapping 20 MHz channels are available in wifi-6E

5. 5+ non-overlapping 80 MHz channels are available in wifi-6 but around 12+ non-overlapping 80 MHz channels are available in wifi-6E

6. 2+ non-overlapping 160 MHz channels (with DFS) are available in wifi-6 but around 7+ non-overlapping clean 160 MHz channels are available in wifi-6E

7. In case of MU-MIMO, many users (around 16 users) can be accommodated simultaneously with single AP. 

8. In case of MLO, efficient channel aggregation can be done for extremely higher data rate in both uplink and downlink. 

9. Use cases for wifi-6E , ultra HD video streaming, AR/VR applications, URLLC, Localisation etc. 

10. Wifi-6E doesn't get affected by legacy wifi devices, Bluetooth, zigbee , microwave ovens operation in vicinity, DFS constraints, Other APs in co-channel (chances are less due to wider spectrum availability)
