MLO

1. It stands for Multi Link Operation. It is one of the groundbreaking innovation in wifi-7.

2. It allows devices to establish and utilize multiple wireless links simultaneously across different frequency bands and channels.

3. It enhances concurrent data transmission, throughput, reduces latency.

4. Simultaneous Transmit Receive MLO (STR) -> it leverages full potential of MLO by simultaneously using different frequency bands using Dual radios. Use case : AR/VR devices that streams HD video in one channel and receives user interaction in other ensuring seamless experience. 

5. Non-STR MLO switches rapidly between transmission and reception links and it is advantageous in some configurations than single link operating devices.

6. Effective throughput is approximately the sum of capacity across each possible links. 

7. It is also possible to do Load balancing with channel aggregation using multiple links or bandsteering based on environment dynamics and data rate requirements. 

8. It enables data transmission even if one link is interrupted via preamble puncturing in channel aggregation.
